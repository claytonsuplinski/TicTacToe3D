/*	BAD DESIGN WARNING...
	This code has not been properly planned and was tossed in right before lecture.
	The useful concepts are that a texture has to be bound to a texture unit (which
	has been hard coded to zero as the shaders making use of this texture will expect
	the sampler2D to be on zero.
